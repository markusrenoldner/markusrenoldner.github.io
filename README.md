## how to get this online:

1. settings/general: (optional, only necessary if this becomes the main homepage) rename the repo to "markusrenoldner.github.io" 
2. settings/general/danger zone: make it public
3. settings/pages: publish size
4. settings/pages: (optional) choose a custom domain (either "[markusrenoldner.com](https://www.markusrenoldner.com/)"; or if already used by "another" homepage, "https://www.markusrenoldner.com/[REPONAME]"
This custom domain (e.g. from namecheap) gets activated (somehow) by storing a file named CNAME in this repo, that contains the URL (i.e. www.markusrenoldner.com)
For this one has to add a "CNAME Record" at namecheap (Host: www; value: markusrenoldner.github.io; TTL: 60 min) in advanced DNS settings; moreover, one potentially has to add so called "A records"
